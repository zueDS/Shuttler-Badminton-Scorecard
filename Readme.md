# Shuttler-Badminton-Scorecard

<br>
Shuttler - Badminton Score and Player Management System employs file handling to
store data such as player details and scores of each player. The program may show
scores of each player and the admin can enter score updates of the players during a
match.

The ‘Shuttler’ project is built on a database, C# object-oriented programming language,
and network techniques. We used MySQL as the best and easiest way to store our
information because we have many areas where we can keep records. The front-end
software of Shuttler is C#, which is an object-oriented programming language that is
linked to a MySQL server. Here to increase the scores of the players we used user
controls in windows forms. Shuttler's necessary modules and features are custom-built
to meet the requirements of each customer.

Software requirements for the project:
Operating System : Windows 7/8/10
Main Software (IDE) : Visual Studio 2022
Front End : #C
Server-Side Script : MySQL
Database : MySQL
Framework : Net Framework 4.7
